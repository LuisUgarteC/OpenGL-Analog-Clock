# Simple Analog Clock in OpenGL using GLUT Library

This repository contains a simple analog clock implementation in C++ using OpenGL and the GLUT library. 
The program creates a window and displays an analog clock with hour segments, hour numbers, and animated clock hands. The clock hands are animated to simulate the movement of time. This project serves as a beginner-friendly example for learning OpenGL and GLUT programming in C++.


Note that this code uses the Windows-specific Sleep function for the animation delay. If you're using a different platform, you may need to replace Sleep with an equivalent function.

To compile and run this code, you'll need to have the GLUT and OpenGL libraries properly installed and configured. Or you can just copy the contents of the 'main.cpp' file and paste it into your own C++ development environment.
